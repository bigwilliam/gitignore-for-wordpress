# gitignore-for-wordpress
GitIgnore File for WordPress Development

Ignores everything by default, and allows you to add allow-listed items to track only what you want.

See: [gitignore](https://github.com/bigwilliam/gitignore-for-wordpress/blob/master/gitignore)

# Installation
From the root of your project run:

```curl -o .gitignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobbman/gitignore-for-wordpress/master/gitignore```

## Notes
* By default all files are ignored.  You'll need to allow-list any mu-plugins, plugins, or themes you want to include in the repo (see last section).
